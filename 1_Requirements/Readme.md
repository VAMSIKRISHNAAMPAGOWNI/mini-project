# Detail requirements
## High Level Requirements:
--- TBD in Tabular Format 
--- ID | Zombie processes usually occur for child processes, as the parent process still needs to read its child’s exit status | Implemented|
--- ID | A child process always first becomes a zombie before being removed from the process table | Implemented |
--- ID  | the orphan process is soon adopted by init process, once its parent process dies |implemented |



##  Low level Requirements:
--- TBD in Tabular Format 
-- ID | either finished or terminated without waiting for its child process to terminate is called an orphan process |Implemented
-- ID  |The parent process reads the exit status of the child process which reaps off the child process entry from the process table|Implemented
